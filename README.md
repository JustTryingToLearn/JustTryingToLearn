## Why We’re Just Trying to Learn

[@samanthabretous](https://twitter.com/samanthabretous) and [@erinfox](https://twitter.com/erinfoox) are both previous bootcamp grads, crushing it as Software Engineers. We are continuing “Teachable Moments”, spontaneous lessons given by our previous tech lead. They include everything from learning technical concepts to going freelance. Because in the end, we really are just trying to learn.

So that’s where this page comes into play. We will (hopefully) be putting out weekly hangout videos of new “Teachable Moments” from smart people in the community. Topics will be a wide variety! We really want to continue learning trusty tips. Below are some examples of topics we’d love to learn about.

* Negotiation
* Standing up for yourself in the workplace
* Git / Git Interactive
* Navigating your tech career
* Write A+ CFP’s
* How to give a really good conference talk
* Basic understandings of tech topics
